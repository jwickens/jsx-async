# `jsx-async`

** not react.js async rendering **

JSX by itself is an amazing innovation in programming, making practical a whole new class of composition and return methods.

`jsx-async` makes it easy to use jsx and simple functional but awaitable components in contexts not requiring react and its tree diffing formula.

By default `jsx-async` returns an rich nested JSON response. You can then process this in turn for a final response.
